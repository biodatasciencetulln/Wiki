In one session of the Bio Data Science summer school, we will set up the computational environment that will be useful for multiple courses. The session will be held online, via Microsoft Teams (alternatively Zoom). Please have the following available:

- Fachhoschule login (username and password)
- Adequate laptop (Windows, macOS or Linux)
- Internet connection
- Headset

As a preparation:

- Install these programs: Microsoft Teams, Zoom, [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/)
- Download the iso file of the latest [Xubuntu](https://xubuntu.org/) LTS release (currently 20.04); the iso can be downloaded via a torrent file or directly from a nearby mirror, e.g. [this one](http://ftp.uni-kl.de/pub/linux/ubuntu-dvd/xubuntu/releases/20.04/release/) â†’ 64-bit PC ([AMD64](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X86-64)) desktop image (filename `xubuntu-20.04.2.0-desktop-amd64.iso`)
    - If you want (this is purely optional), you can verify the integrity of the downloaded file as explained on [ubuntu.com](https://ubuntu.com/tutorials/how-to-verify-ubuntu) or [pctipp.ch](https://www.pctipp.ch/praxis/windows-10/windows-10-sha256-hash-bordmitteln-pruefen-2507915.html)
- Download the Anaconda installer for Linux-x86 (from [anaconda.com](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual); the downloaded file should have a filename like `Anaconda3-20xx.xx-Linux-x86_64.sh`)
- Download the Visual Studio Code installer for Debian, Ubuntu ([code.visualstudio.com](https://code.visualstudio.com/Download))
- Create an account on [GitHub](https://github.com/)

Note regarding Apple silicon computers (Macbooks since 2020, with M1 chip or later; this processor architecture is referred to as AArch64 or ARM64):

- The transition of established workflows to ARM-based processors is still ongoing, and therefore experimental
- Install the [UTM app](https://mac.getutm.app/)
- Download the iso file of the latest [Ubuntu Server](https://ubuntu.com/download/server/arm) LTS release (currently 20.04), according to [mac.getutm.app](https://mac.getutm.app/gallery/ubuntu-20-04)
- For the Linux virtual machine, you should probably download the Anaconda installer for Linux-aarch64, according to [docs.anaconda.com](https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/linux-aarch64/).
    - In case of problems, you can also install Anaconda directly on macOS. It can be run using Rosetta or an (experimental) ARM64 distribution, according to [anaconda.com](https://www.anaconda.com/blog/apple-silicon-transition).
