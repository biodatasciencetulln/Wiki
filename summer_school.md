In one session of the Bio Data Science summer school, we will set up the computational environment that will be useful for multiple courses. The session will be held online, via Microsoft Teams (alternatively Zoom). Please have the following available:

- Fachhoschule login (username and password)
- Adequate laptop (Windows, macOS or Linux)
- Internet connection
- Headset
- Installed programs: Microsoft Teams, Zoom, [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/)
- Downloaded iso file of the latest [Xubuntu](https://xubuntu.org/) LTS release (currently 20.04); the iso can be downloaded via a torrent file or directly from a nearby mirror, e.g. [this one](http://ftp.uni-kl.de/pub/linux/ubuntu-dvd/xubuntu/releases/20.04/release/) â†’ 64-bit PC ([AMD64](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X86-64)) desktop image (filename `xubuntu-20.04.2.0-desktop-amd64.iso`)
    - If you want (this is purely optional), you can verify the integrity of the downloaded file as explained on [ubuntu.com](https://ubuntu.com/tutorials/how-to-verify-ubuntu) or [pctipp.ch](https://www.pctipp.ch/praxis/windows-10/windows-10-sha256-hash-bordmitteln-pruefen-2507915.html)
- Downloaded Anaconda installer for Linux-x86 (from [anaconda.com](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual); the downloaded file should have a filename like `Anaconda3-20xx.xx-Linux-x86_64.sh`)
- Apple silicon computers (Macbooks since 2020, with M1 chip or later; this processor architecture is referred to as AArch64 or ARM64): The transition of established workflows to ARM-based processors is still ongoing, and therefore experimental
    - Installed [UTM app](https://mac.getutm.app/)
    - Downloaded iso file of the latest [Ubuntu Server](https://ubuntu.com/download/server/arm) LTS release (currently 20.04), according to [mac.getutm.app](https://mac.getutm.app/gallery/ubuntu-20-04)
    - For the Linux virtual machine, you should probably download the Anaconda installer for Linux-aarch64, according to [docs.anaconda.com](https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/linux-aarch64/). In case of problems, you can install Anaconda directly on macOS. It can be run using Rosetta or an (experimental) ARM64 distribution, according to [anaconda.com](https://www.anaconda.com/blog/apple-silicon-transition).

As a preparation, watch the videos "What is a Virtual Machine (VM)? In 3 minutes - Virtual Machine Tutorial for Beginners" ([YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yIVXjl4SwVo)) and "Virtualization & Virtual Machines \| simply explained in 15 Mins" by TechWorld with Nana, 2021 ([YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQP0wqNT_DI)).
